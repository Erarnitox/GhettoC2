# Ghetto C2

Welcome to the Repository of Ghetto C2.
The worst C2 Framework written completely in Rust.

It is very incomplete right now and will never become a fully functioning C2 framework.
It will be developed on further in the future but it really only meant to be a playground for features as well as an educational resource
to learn about how a very basic C2 framework might fundamentally work.
